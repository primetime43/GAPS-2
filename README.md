# GAPS 2

GAPS 2 is a rewrite of the original [GAPS](https://github.com/JasonHHouse/gaps) project, now written in Python instead of Java. GAPS (Gaps A Plex Server) finds movies you're missing in your Plex Server. It's a great way to find additional movies that you might be interested in based on collections from movies in your Plex Server.

The GAPS 2 project aims to bring the same functionality with the simplicity and versatility of Python.

## Features

- Finds missing movies in Plex libraries based on collections
- Lists missing and existing movies within collections
- Easy to use interface
- Now written in Python for easy deployment and updates

## TODO

- Add the back end functionality
- Fix/finish overall functionality that's missing from the original code
- Fix bugs & add updates to refactor code for simplicity

## Installation

Run the python file and it will be locally hosted at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
